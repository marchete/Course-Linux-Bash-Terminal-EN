# About Linux Bash Terminal
This course is designed as a fast, introductory course to Linux command-line interface (CLI).

Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are heavily used on end-user computers, but many Linux servers don't need a graphical interface. This just clutters the servers and add another attack layer. 

Even Microsoft used this approach with Windows Server Core and Server Nano. 

This playground is 100% focused on giving a practical approach, there will be as little theory as possible, and a lot of interactive exercises.

Thanks to the virtualization technology of https://tech.io you just need a modern browser to follow this course. You don't need either a computer or install Linux to practice it.


## Previous Knowledge:

Regular Expressions (Regex) will be used on some chapters of this course. You can learn more about Regular Expressions here: https://tech.io/playgrounds/218/regular-expressions-basics .

Knowledge of MS-DOS or other command-line interfaces is a plus.

## Difficulty Level: 
Intermediate.

## Estimated Time:
60 minutes.

## What will I learn?
Students will learn the most important features of Linux Bash Terminals:
* Navigation and file listing.
* File and Folder manipulation
* Basics on Permission and Ownership
* Installing packages
* Process and services
* I/O Redirection
* Piping and Other useful commands
* Creating scripts
* Scheduled tasks


## Why should I learn?
There are many systems and services that are fully based on headless Linux, so you can only take full advantage of them via linux console:
- There are many operations that are easily described and executed on command-line, impossible to do via GUI.
- Linux Servers in general haven't any GUI installed. 
- Amazon Web Service (AWS) Command Line, and other Cloud services.
- Many CCTV, Access Points, IoT and network equipment use embedded linux, only accesible via web or terminal.

In my work I manage more than 20 linux servers, none of them use GUI. All is done via Bash terminal.
You may think command-line interfaces are outdated, and not so useful. Once you start using it you'll understand the benefit of them.
